# CLAUDE-FACTORY.md — the OgenticAI Software Factory contract

This file is the **factory partial**. It contains only what the agents need to know about how the factory operates — not what this repo is, not your stack, not your architecture rules. Those stay in your existing `CLAUDE.md`.

**How to use it.** Two options:

1. **Import it from your existing `CLAUDE.md`** by adding one line near the bottom:

   ```markdown
   ## Factory contract
   @./.claude/CLAUDE-FACTORY.md
   ```

2. **Paste it inline** if your Claude Code version doesn't support `@file` imports. Copy this entire file's contents into a new section of your existing `CLAUDE.md`. It's self-contained.

Either way, **do not let this file silently overwrite anything you wrote.** It is additive.

## §F1 — Where the factory lives in this repo

- Agent definitions: `.claude/agents/` (12 core + 3 extensions: library-publisher, rust-builder, compliance-reviewer)
- Orchestrator skills: `.claude/skills/feature-factory/`, `build-with-tests/`, `repo-bootstrap/`, `multi-repo-coordinator/`, `project-planner/`, `project-factory/`, `repo-create/`, `fleet-onboarding/`, `new-from-knowledge/`
- Hooks: `.claude/hooks/pre-commit`, `.claude/hooks/pre-push`
- Multi-repo registry: `.claude/registry/repos.yml`
- Linear integration contract: `.claude/LINEAR-INTEGRATION.md` — every agent links here.

If you reorganise this layout, update §F1.

## §F2 — Linear conventions (OgenticAI, team OGE)

The factory grounds every run in a Linear ticket. No exceptions. These are the OgenticAI-specific values the agents expect.

**Linear workspace:** Ogenticai
**Linear team key:** `OGE`
**Primary project for this repo:** TODO — fill in. Match the `linear_project` field for this repo in `.claude/registry/repos.yml`.

**Linear identity (factory bot).** Every `[factory:*]` **comment** MUST be authored by the factory bot (`factory-bot@ogenticai.com` / "OgenticAI Factory Bot"), never a human — comments are the audit trail. Reads and ticket state/labels may run through the operator's human Linear connector (acceptable attribution). Claude caps Linear connectors at two (both used by human workspaces), so the bot has **no connector** — it posts comments via the **Linear API** using `LINEAR_FACTORY_TOKEN` (its personal API key), out-of-band from the MCP connector, exactly like OgenticAI Reviewer's `LINEAR_API_TOKEN`. This is the Linear analogue of the §F5 git-identity gate. `setup-check` (check #6) confirms `LINEAR_FACTORY_TOKEN` is set and resolves to the bot — a hard gate (skip with `OGENTICAI_BYPASS_IDENTITY`). Runbook: `docs/LINEAR-BOT-SETUP.md`. Full contract: `LINEAR-INTEGRATION.md` §14.

**State machine.** The factory walks tickets through:
```
Backlog → In Progress → In Review → Done
```
- `In Progress` — set by Researcher (first step).
- `In Review` — set by Linear's GitHub integration when the PR opens.
- `Done` — set on PR merge.

If your team uses different state names, list the mapping here. The orchestrator falls back to the closest equivalent and logs the substitution.

**Branch naming.** Always use Linear's auto-generated branch name (copy it from the ticket's "Copy branch name" affordance). Example: `oge-123-invoice-reminders-7d`. This is what links the PR to the ticket and what OgenticAI Reviewer uses to find the linked UAT checklist.

**Labels** the factory uses (auto-created on first run if missing):

| Label | Set by | Removed by |
|---|---|---|
| `factory-in-progress` | Researcher (first step) | Release Manager (last step) |
| `needs-story-approval` | Story Writer | Spec Writer (after Checkpoint 1) |
| `needs-brief-approval` | Spec Writer | First Builder (after Checkpoint 2) |
| `building` | First Builder | Test Verifier |
| `validator-blocked` | Validator on Critical | Validator when next pass is Clean |
| `security-blocked` | Security Reviewer on Critical | Security Reviewer when Clean |
| `compliance-blocked` | Compliance Reviewer on Critical | Compliance Reviewer when Clean |
| `from-validator` / `from-security` / `from-compliance` | applied to sub-issues from findings | manual |
| `deferred-question` | applied to sub-issues from open questions | manual |
| `cross-repo` | Spec Writer when brief spans repos | manual |
| `factory-degraded` | Orchestrator when Linear MCP partial | Orchestrator on reconnect |
| `factory-paused` | Orchestrator on stall > 24h | manual |
| `incident` + priority 1 | Incident Responder | manual / on resolution |
| `project-factory-running` | Project Factory (per ticket on enqueue) | Project Factory (on ticket reaching pr-open / factory-paused) |

**Acceptance criteria** live as Linear **checkboxes** in the ticket description. Test Verifier ticks them on pass; Validator reads them to confirm coverage. See `.claude/LINEAR-INTEGRATION.md` §8.

**Auto-added criteria.** If this repo imports `@ogenticai/shield` or `@ogenticai/audit`, or is in the Therapy / Private Credit verticals, the Story Writer **always** appends these three criteria:
- `- [ ] PHI / privilege / MNPI handling routes through Shield before any LLM call`
- `- [ ] An audit event is emitted via Ogentic-Audit for every state change`
- `- [ ] Tenant isolation verified by an explicit test`

**Checkpoint approval.** David can approve either:
- In chat: reply `/approved` or `approved`
- In Linear: remove the relevant `needs-X-approval` label, or post a comment `/approved`

**OgenticAI Reviewer** already exists and lives in GitHub. On PR open it audits the diff against the linked Linear ticket's UAT checklist and blocks merge on fail. The factory's Validator and Security Reviewer **complement** it (catching things before the PR opens); they do not duplicate its checks.

## §F3 — Agent sign-off block

Every factory agent ends its final message with a structured summary so the next agent (and the human at checkpoints) can read the state quickly. This is the canonical shape:

```
SUMMARY
- Ticket: <OGE-xxx>
- Files added: ...
- Files edited: ...
- Patterns reused: ...
- New rules CLAUDE.md should learn from this work: ...
- Open questions for the next agent / human: ...
```

The "New rules" line is how your `CLAUDE.md` grows over time. Whenever an agent had to guess, surface the assumption. Every guess that wasn't perfectly right earns a new rule in your `CLAUDE.md` next session.

---

## §F4 — What the factory will NOT touch in your existing CLAUDE.md

Hard rule: the factory **never** edits `CLAUDE.md`. It surfaces rule-additions in its sign-off summaries. You decide whether to add them.

Sections 1–8 (or whatever your existing sections are) are yours. The factory reads them; it does not write them.

If you want the factory's section to live elsewhere — different filename, different folder, included from a higher-level memory file — change the `@./.claude/CLAUDE-FACTORY.md` import in your `CLAUDE.md` and update §F1 here to match. The agents discover everything via that file path.

## §F5 — Git identity (OgenticAI org-admin discipline)

Every commit pushed to an OgenticAI repo must be authored by an OgenticAI identity and pushed under the org-admin gh account. Mis-attributed commits break Vercel preview attribution, distort PR contributor signals, and confuse OgenticAI Reviewer's UAT-gating.

**Canonical gh CLI user:**

```
davidoladeji-ogenticai    # has admin:org on OgenticAI
```

`davidoladeji` (the personal account) **must not** be the active gh user for any factory push.

**Canonical commit author email:**

- Any `@ogenticai.com` address — typically `david@ogenticai.com` for now.
- Or the no-reply form for the org-admin: `davidoladeji-ogenticai@users.noreply.github.com`.

`davidoladeji@users.noreply.github.com` is **not** approved — it attributes to the wrong GitHub account.

**One-time machine setup** (the operator runs this on their laptop, not the agents):

```
git config --global user.email david@ogenticai.com
gh auth switch -u davidoladeji-ogenticai
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/ogenticai_plugins  # macOS
```

**Enforcement** — the kit's `.claude/hooks/pre-push` blocks any push where:

1. `gh auth` is active as anything other than `davidoladeji-ogenticai`, **or**
2. any commit in the push range has an author email outside the approved set.

To bypass for a single push (use sparingly, explain in the PR description):

```
OGENTICAI_BYPASS_IDENTITY=1 git push ...
```

**Verification** — agents that touch the network may call the `setup-check` skill at the top of their run to fail fast on identity drift. The `feature-factory`, `repo-bootstrap`, `repo-create`, and `fleet-onboarding` skills do this automatically.

### §F5a — Multi-account machines: flip-proof git identity

On a machine that carries **two GitHub accounts on `github.com`** — one personal, one OgenticAI work account (e.g. personal `denkodes` + work `den-ogenticai`) — `gh`'s single "active account" per host **silently flips back to the personal account**. Since that account has no OgenticAI access, every OgenticAI `git push/pull/clone` and `gh` call then 404s. `gh auth switch` is a manual band-aid that drifts again.

**The durable fix (machine-local, no SSH required):** pin all git auth under `~/OgenticAI/` to the work account via a directory-scoped credential helper, independent of the active account. `gh auth token -u <work-account>` returns that account's token **even when it is not active** — that is the lever.

1. `~/.gitconfig` routes by directory:
   ```
   [includeIf "gitdir:~/OgenticAI/"]
       path = ~/.config/git/ogenticai.inc
   ```
2. `~/.config/git/ogenticai.inc` clears the inherited active-account helper and pins the work account (replace `den-ogenticai` / `<you>@ogenticai.com` with the operator's):
   ```
   [user]
       email = <you>@ogenticai.com
       name  = <You>
   [credential "https://github.com"]
       helper =                                                   # clears !gh auth git-credential (follows active account)
       helper = ~/.config/git/ogenticai-credential-helper.sh      # always serves the work account
       username = den-ogenticai
   ```
3. `~/.config/git/ogenticai-credential-helper.sh` (chmod +x):
   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   [ "$1" = "get" ] || exit 0
   tok=$(gh auth token -u den-ogenticai 2>/dev/null) || exit 0
   [ -n "$tok" ] || exit 0
   echo "username=den-ogenticai"; echo "password=$tok"
   ```

Result: every repo under `~/OgenticAI/` authenticates as the work account regardless of `gh`'s active account; personal repos outside that path are untouched. **Acid test:** force the personal account active, then `git ls-remote` an OgenticAI repo — it must still succeed.

**Still bind the SSH key to the work account.** The `ssh-add ~/.ssh/ogenticai_plugins` step above only helps if that key's public half is **registered to the work account** on GitHub (`github.com/settings/ssh/new`, logged in as the work account → `ssh -T git@github.com` returns `Hi <work-account>`). The HTTPS pin covers plain `git`/`gh`; the `ogenticai-git` plugin and any SSH-remote flow need the registered key.

**`gh` CLI commands** (`gh pr`, `gh api`) still follow the active account — keep it on the work account (`gh auth switch -u <work-account>`), but the critical git push/pull/clone path no longer depends on it.

## §F6 — Kit propagation (how this repo stays in sync with `agent-factory`)

When the kit on `OgenticAI/agent-factory` changes (a new agent role, a tightened hook, a clarified Linear convention), every onboarded repo should pick that change up without anyone having to copy files by hand.

**How it works**

- A workflow on `agent-factory` (`.github/workflows/propagate-factory-kit.yml`) watches for pushes to `main` that touch `kit/.claude/**`.
- For each repo in `kit/.claude/registry/repos.yml` (filtered to non-stale entries), it opens a sync PR titled `chore(factory): sync kit from agent-factory@<sha>`.
- The sync respects this repo's `.claude/_factory-manifest.yml`. For every tracked file:
  - new file → copied in (additive)
  - file unchanged since the last sync → overwritten with the new kit version
  - file hand-edited locally → **left alone**; the divergence is listed in the sync PR body
  - file path in `opt_out:` → skipped entirely
- Purely-additive sync PRs with no preserved local edits get the `factory-sync-auto-merge` label and merge themselves once CI is green. Anything else waits for human review.

**Files the propagator never touches**

- `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (per-repo, operator-owned).
- `.claude/registry/repos.yml` (per-repo customisations).
- Anything you've explicitly added to `.claude/_factory-manifest.yml`'s `opt_out:` list.

**Opting a file out of propagation**

Open `.claude/_factory-manifest.yml` and add the path under `opt_out:`:

```yaml
opt_out:
  - .claude/agents/05-frontend-builder.md
```

After that, propagation will never overwrite the file in this repo.

**Forcing a re-sync**

In `agent-factory` → Actions → "Propagate factory kit" → "Run workflow". Choose `non-stale` or pass an explicit comma-separated list of repo names.

## §F7 — Org-knowledge (the `factory.knowledge_enabled` feature flag)

The factory can consult **org-knowledge** — the org's unified search across Slack, Notion, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, GitHub, OneDrive, and Documents — to ground new work in what the team has already discussed. This is delivered by the `mcp-orgknowledge` plugin (in `OgenticAI/ogenticai-plugins`), which wraps the org-knowledge `/api/v1/search` API (Linear ticket `OGE-590`).

**Default: off.** Until the operator turns it on per-repo, none of the agents call the API. This is deliberate — the API is still in flight (Track C Phase 1), and we want every repo to opt-in once it's live and the operator has generated a token.

**How to turn it on for this repo.**

1. Generate an API key at `orgknowledge.ogenticai.com → Settings → API keys`. Label it `agent-factory · <repo-name>`.
2. Export the token where Cowork runs (host shell, not sandbox):
   ```sh
   export ORGKNOWLEDGE_API_TOKEN="okak_<prefix>_<secret>"
   ```
3. Install the `mcp-orgknowledge` Cowork plugin from the `ogenticai-plugins` marketplace.
4. Add this line to this repo's `CLAUDE.md` (anywhere — convention is §6 / "Open questions for the operator" — or replace this whole sentence with a fresh §7 if you prefer):

   ```
   factory.knowledge_enabled: true
   ```

5. Verify: in a Cowork session, ask the `mcp-orgknowledge:orgknowledge_health` tool to run. It should return `{ok: true, …}`.

**Which agents read it.**

| Agent / skill | What it does with org-knowledge |
|---|---|
| `researcher` | Calls `orgknowledge_search` as Step 0 of every feature-factory run; posts a `[factory:researcher] knowledge digest` comment on the Linear ticket. |
| `project-planner` | Calls `orgknowledge_search` in §0 before drafting; halts and asks the operator if the ask fits an existing project. |
| `new-from-knowledge` | Periodically scans for "decisions without tickets" and proposes Linear issues. |

**Privacy / Shield.** Snippets from `orgknowledge_search` can contain PHI, privilege, or MNPI. Agents must **not** copy snippets verbatim into Linear comments if this repo imports `@ogenticai/shield` or sits in the Therapy / Private Credit verticals. Paraphrase one sentence; rely on `source_url` for inspection.

**Rollback.** Set `factory.knowledge_enabled: false` in this repo's `CLAUDE.md` (or remove the line — false is the default). Agents will skip the org-knowledge step silently and note `factory.knowledge_enabled=false` in their output.

**Failure semantics.** While the API is in flight, every call returns `code: UNREACHABLE`. Agents must treat this as a no-op and continue, not a halt. Once `OGE-590` ships, the same flag flip turns the calls into a hard signal.
